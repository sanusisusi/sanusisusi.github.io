# My Portfolio Web App

## A project built for my portfolio as a Software Engineer

A clean and nice web portfolio for myself. 
It includes almost everything you want to show. 
At first, my name, links to my social networks and a great image. Then the About section displays more information about me. Then the list of Skills i offers. It also has a section where it shows some of my recent work. And at the bottom it has a contact form, and at the end with a footer.
